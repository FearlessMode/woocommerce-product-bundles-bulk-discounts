# WooCommerce Product Bundles - Bundle-Sells

### What's This?

Mini-extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) that allows you offer bulk discounts in Product Bundles by associating bundled product quantities with discount values.

### Using Bundle-Sells

Bundle-Sells can be added to any product by navigating to **Product Data > Linked Products** tab and adding some products to the "Bundle-Sells" box.

Bundle-Sells are displayed above the add-to-cart button in single product pages. They can be selected and added to the cart along with the viewed product:

At core, bundle-sells share many similarities with cross-sells. Compared to cross-sells, bundle-sells:

* are easier to discover; and
* convert immediately.

However, bundle-sells _must_ be used sparingly -- offerring many and/or unrelated options may have a negative impact on conversion. Use bundle-sells to offer **relevant**, **helpful** recommendations. If in doubt, look for strong, **data-driven evidence** to support your decisions.
